# Social Capital Infrastructure

_Events, initiatives, facilities, groups, and organizations (excluding single-nation government entities) that foster social cohesion and support._

## Description
An approach to understanding the social fabric shaping our world. The dream is to map this network of entities to assess the strength, stability, and resilience to changing environments within and between communities and nations. Additionally, it could be used to identify opportunities for business, government, and individual actors. There is a lot of potential for something like this to help address or identify many societal challenges. The major roadblock I have encountered is identifying the partnerships, collaborations, and shared spaces (the edges) that connect this infrastructure (the nodes).
